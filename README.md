# Algorithms-I
Assignment solutions for Princeton University's Algorithm I course on Coursera. All assignments require the algs4.jar provided by Princeton University for this course

## Percolation
Percolation system using Weighted Quick Unions in order to determine the average-minimum randomly opened sites it takes to achieve percolation.
- Weighted Quick Union
- Java Random & Std utilities

## Randomized Queues and Deques
Deque class (able to remove from front and back) and randomized queue class (removed items in random sequence)
- Queue and Stack class attributes
- Linked list and variable resizing arrays
- Item iterators

## Collinear Points
Calculate and determine line segments that connect 4 or more points that are collinear using a brute force method and sorting method.
- Arrays.sort() method to calculate collinear points significantly faster (n^2 logn compared to n^4)
- Implement Comprable and Comparator classes for additional sorting techniques
